This is a repo containing codes implemented in python 3

These include stuff from the very basic list and dictionary manipulation to more complex structured programs including: functions, comprehensions, generators, mail transfer protocol, database manipulation, socket programming, and object oriented programming.

Each program works on it's own without any dependencies. 

Each .py file is a python script which will require a python client to run, or can be run through the command prompt/terminal/powershell by invoking the python 3 environment.

I shall be updating this repo with further codes as i make them.

This does not include any of the data science modules (numpy, scipy, pandas, matplotlib+plotly, scikitlearn) or the other deep learning stuff (keras, theano, tensorflow), the web scraping tools (scrapy) or the natural language processing tools (NLTK) 
I will be making separate repos for each of those later on, when i get into them.

Thanks.
